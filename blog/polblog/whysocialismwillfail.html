    <h1>Why Socialism Failed</h1>
    <hr>
    <template id="markdown-template">
        There is something people, mainly college students in the west always dream of, its called socialism. 
        socialism is seen as this really great thing, a utopia, a way of people for people to work together.    
    </template>
    <template id="markdown-template">
        Ironically though, most of these people who LOVE socialism, are also people living in the west for some reason, which kinda makes your argument kinda invalid in my honest opinion.
        But lets explain it in a way that they can understand
    </template>

    <template id="markdown-template">
        First of all, there is the main argument for socialism, "workers will be free from the oppression of the upper class". In the beginning, it sounds really well. Like really well.
        But when you start to look at their solutions, it kinda gets a bit sketchy. First of all, they say that through this, you MUST give power to the state so they can eliminate the rich.
        The thing is, the government should NOT be trusted most of the time. Theres proof from all places on how a power government lead to massive counts of oppression. It leads to even worse 
        oppression then the oppression of the rich.

    <template id="markdown-template">
        Another issue of socialism is the fact that workers will be paid by the state no matter what. Lets say a worker gets lazy, they will be paid even though they are lazy. It leads to this
        effect that productivity of a socialist nation doesn't even work, the workers are just way too lazy.

    <template id="markdown-template">
        Their is also the issue of no competition. You might say, thats good! Competition is bad. But heres the thing. Do you know why you are using your computer, let it be mac or windows. 
        And do you know why you are using your browser? And do you know why we have advanced so much? Its because of competition in a capitalist world. Competition leads to quicker advancements.
        It leads to innovations because everyone wants to be ahead of everyone else. Thats why socialism ended up with very horrible products. Their was a car in East Germany for example, 
    </template>
    <template id="markdown-template">
        So Whats The solutions you are proposing, you can't really be promoting capitalism? Here is what im proposing. Capitalism has it flaws too, no one is saying it doesn't
        But the thing is, socialism isn't a good alternative to it. All socialism is is a extreme opposite of capitalism.
    </template>
    <template id="markdown-template">
        I want one thing and one thing only. A system where your hard-work is rewarded while not being in a wage-system. A system where big government isn't spying on us while the rich is put in place.
        Will we ever get this, I can't say. But it's my ideal economic idea.
